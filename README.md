## Overview
**Slide Scribe** aims to solve the inconvenience of writing notes on top of cramped slide PDFs by generating a new PDF layout:
- One or more slides per page
- Extra blank lines or space to take notes
- Flexible orientation (portrait or landscape)

Eventually, users will be able to upload their slide PDFs, choose a layout, and download a freshly generated PDF tailored for note-taking.

---

## Features
- **Upload a PDF** of slides directly in the web interface.
- **Choose your layout**:
  - 1 slide per page, 2 slides per page, or more (planned).
- **Adjust orientation**:
  - Portrait or landscape.
- **Add note lines** on each page.
- **Download** the rearranged PDF with one click.

---

## Demo (Planned)
We will host this app on a service (e.g., [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)) for an accessible live demo.  
A link to the deployed app will be added here once it's live.
